                        Most people think a personal brand is a logo or a tagline. It's not.
                    </p>

                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Your personal brand is the total experience of you. It's what people see when you walk into a room, how they feel when you speak, and what they find when they Google your name. In 2025, trust is the new currency, and consistency across these three areas Dressing, Behaviour, and Digital Presence is how you earn it.

                        If these three pillars don't align, you create a "brand gap." If they do, you become unforgettable.

                        1. Dressing: The Visual Language of Leadership
                    </h2>

                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Science confirms that people form an impression of you within seven seconds of meeting you. Before you utter a single word, your clothes have already announced your confidence, your attention to detail, and your respect for the occasion.
                    </p>

                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        But this isn't about chasing trends. It's about intentionality.

                        Dress for the Role You Want, Not Just the One You Have
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Research shows that wearing "power clothing" (like a well-fitted blazer or structured jacket) actually changes your brain chemistry, making you feel more authoritative and focused. This is called "enclothed cognition."
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">
                        Create a "Signature Style"
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Consistency builds memory. Think of Steve Jobs' turtlenecks or Anna Wintour's bob. You don't need a uniform, but having a consistent silhouette or color palette makes you visually recognizable and reinforces your brand identity.

                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Build a work wardrobe where 70% of your pieces are timeless neutrals (navy, black, beige, grey) and 30% are personality pieces (colors, prints, or accessories) that tell your unique story.

                        2. Behaviour: The "Hidden" Brand Builder
                    </h2>

                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Your visual brand gets you in the door, but your behavioral brand keeps you there. Behaviour is simply your values in action.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">

                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        A strong personal brand is reliable. If you are calm and strategic one day but reactive and chaotic the next, people won't know which "version" of you to trust.
                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Executive presence isn't just about big speeches. It's in how you listen, how you hold eye contact, and how you treat people who can do nothing for you. Authenticity creates a foundation of trust that no marketing campaign can buy.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">
                        Alignment with Your Visuals
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        If you are dressed in a sharp, authoritative suit but your body language is closed off and your voice is hesitant, you create cognitive dissonance. Your non-verbal cues must match your visual authority.
                    </p>

                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        In a digital-first world, your online presence is often your first impression. Recruiters, clients, and partners will look you up before they ever shake your hand.
                    </p>

                    <p className="leading-relaxed italic">
                        Does your LinkedIn profile match the person they meet in real life?

                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Google yourself today. Do the results position you as a thought leader? If not, it's time to curate. Your digital profile should be a mirror of your real-world expertise.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">
                        Consistency is Key
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Your profile photo, bio, and tone of voice should be consistent across LinkedIn, Instagram, and your personal website. A fragmented online presence dilutes your authority.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">
                        Shift from "Consumer" to "Creator"
                    </h3>
                    <p className="leading-relaxed">
                        Don't just scroll. Share insights, comment on industry trends, and showcase your expertise. In 2025, a silent digital brand is an invisible one.
